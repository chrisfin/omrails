			<div class="about_head">What is Fleur?</div>
			Fleur embodies the journey that is fashion. It's about browsing styles you've never seen and discovering things you did not know you had to own. It's Tinder for clothes. It's Pinterest, but tamed and manageable. It's as if we built an online retailer just for you. 
			</br>

			<div class="about_head">How does Fleur work?</div>
			<p>We start by hand-selecting a diverse collection of clothes from everywhere. We work hard to make sure every image is worth seeing and every item is shoppable. </p><p>Then you browse the images by clicking Yes! and Less to tell us what you think. We save your Yes!'s to your catalog where you can shop the looks. We hide the Less's. As Fleur learns what you like, it gets better as showing you things it knows you'll love. Simple, right?</p>

			<div class="about_head">How does Fleur make money?</div>
			<p>Well, we don't really make much money yet, but we have some ideas to keep the lights on. For instance, if you end up buying something you saw on Fleur, we get a small cut of the sale from the retailer. This is only applicable for a small number of the items on the site and our merchants have no idea which ones they are. This way, our merchants can concentrate on just finding you the best styles.</p>


			<div class="about_head">Is this the end?</div>
			Of course not. This is just the beginning for Fleur. We're working hard to get personalization right. We also want Fleur to be everywhere you are.
